Steps
1.	Open VS 2019 -> Create New project -> Set the language as C# -> Search for Windows Forms App (.NET framework) -> Create the application.

2.	Right Click on Folder -> Add -> New Item -> Data -> Service Based Database -> Provide a name and then click on Add.

3.	Go to View and Click on Server Explorer -> Right Click on tables and Click on Add a Table -> Create the table by providing the required name and their datatype. The script would look like this:

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Customers]
(
	[Id] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
    [FullName] NCHAR(100) NULL, 
    [Email] VARCHAR(150) NULL, 
    [Address] NVARCHAR(150) NULL, 
    [Phone] VARCHAR(25) NULL, 
    [Gender] BIT NULL
)

Rename the table name -> Update the table by clicking on Update and then Click on Update Database.
4.	Go to View -> Other Windows -> Data Sources -> Click on Add New Data Source. (If Data Sources has nothing on it then save the application and restart the VS 2019) -> Click on Database 
-> Dataset -> Click on “Show the connection string that you will save in the application”. Copy the below string in some other notepad file:

Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\Database1.mdf;Integrated Security=True

Then Provide a name -> Check on Table and Customers and Provide its name as ModelDataSet

5.	In Data Sources Click on Edit DataSet with Designer and Keep it as it is -> In Data Sources Click on Customers Dropdown button and Click on Details 
-> Inside Customers Click on Every Variables dropdown button and click on TextBox except for Gender, it should have Checkbox 
-> Drag the Customer Icon and Drop it in Main Forms1 -> Delete the ID Variable and its TextBox from the Main View

6.	Click on Customers Dropdown button and select DataGridView and drag the Customers below the already dragged Details Customers 
-> Click on Gender’s Properties in Details and Change its Text as ?? and click on “Lighting type” button and Click or Double click on CheckedChanged

7.	In Forms1.cs update the Gender part of the code as: 
if (genderCheckBox.CheckState == CheckState.Checked)
                genderCheckBox.Text = "Male";
            else if (genderCheckBox.CheckState == CheckState.Unchecked)
                genderCheckBox.Text = "Female";
            else
              genderCheckBox.Text = "??";

8.	In the Forms1 properties Edit the Name as LocalDB and StartPosition as CenterScreen
9.	In the ModelDataSet Edit the properties of ID: AutoIncrement as True and both the Seed and Step as 1.
